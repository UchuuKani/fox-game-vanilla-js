# Init the Project

The idea behind `init.js` is to set up our game, kind of the entry point in the browser

We will have a clock that ticks the game every three seconds. Could try to use a bunch of `setTimeout`s, but will make the project very difficult to coordinate with all the async stuff going on

`requestAnimationFrame` is a browser api (look up docs) - basically saying, hey browser, when you're idle call this callback - in reality, the game will tick a lot as the browser is idle a lot

**Note:** according to MDN, "The window.requestAnimationFrame() method tells the browser that you wish to perform an animation and requests that the browser calls a specified function to update an animation before the next repaint. The method takes a callback as an argument to be invoked before the repaint."

In Brian's words, the `requestAnimationFrame` function:

- "This is a technique where we can say to the browser, "Hey! Browser! Next time you have an idle moment, call me ðŸ˜‰" complete with winky face. As you may imagine, this can be very frequent, and we don't want our to execute at lightspeed. So in this case, we're saying, "check to see if it's been 3 seconds. If it has, call tick. If not, chill and wait for the next frame. This way, we're guaranteed to run tick every three seconds, give or take a few milliseconds (since the browser will wait until it's idle to call.)"

A snapshot of the `init.js` code with some of my own comments is below

```js
const TICK_RATE = 3000;

function tick() {
  console.log("tick", Date.now());
}

async function init() {
  // async function not required just here for later use potentially
  console.log("starting game");

  let nextTimeToTick = Date.now();
  // create this closure around nextTimeToTick using nextAnimationFrame so that nextTimeToTick is still available to be updated
  function nextAnimationFrame() {
    const now = Date.now();
    if (nextTimeToTick <= now) {
      // if we move the tick() call and nextTimeToTick reassignment outside the if block
      // then it seems tick() constantly gets called and nextTimeToTick is constantly updated
      tick();
      nextTimeToTick = now + TICK_RATE;
    }
    requestAnimationFrame(nextAnimationFrame); // rather than returning nextAnimationFrame to create a closure, we call requestAnimationFrame with nextAnimationFrame passed in as a callback to be run whenever the browser is idle
  }

  nextAnimationFrame();
}

init();
```

If we add `init.js` in a script tag in our `index.html` file and try to run the app, "it's very likely you'll get a gross error saying regeneratorRuntime is not defined. We need to tell Babel (which Parcel uses under the hood) to not transpile our async call and to leave it as async since modern Edge/Firefox/Safari/Chrome can understand async/await. So head to your package.json and add this:"

```js
{
  [â€¦]
  "browserslist": [
    "last 2 Firefox versions"
  ]
}
```
